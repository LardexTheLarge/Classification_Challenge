## Introduction

As part of this project, you will develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model to improve the email filtering system for an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The provided dataset contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The goal is to create two classification models, a logistic regression model, and a random forest model, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam emails.

## Features

- Development of logistic regression and random forest classification models
- Evaluation of model accuracy in detecting spam emails
- Improvement of the email filtering system for the ISP's customers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python environment with necessary libraries for machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:LardexTheLarge/Classification_Challenge.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
    cd Classification_Challenge
```

3. Run scripts to train and evaluate the classification models.

## Usage

1. Open the logistic regression and random forest model files.
2. Train and evaluate each model using the provided dataset.

## Documentation

The code is documented with inline comments to explain its functionality. You can refer to the comments in the code for details on how it works.
